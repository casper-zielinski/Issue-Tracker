# Claude Guidelines

## File Modification Policy

### DO NOT modify files unless:
1. Explicitly requested by the user
2. User has given explicit permission for that specific file

### BEFORE making any changes:
1. **Always ask permission** before modifying any file
2. **Inform the user** which files need to be changed and why
3. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding

### When suggesting changes:
- Clearly state which files would be affected
- Explain why each file needs to be modified
- Ask for explicit permission before making any edits

### Exception:
- Only modify files when the user has directly instructed me to do so
- If a change requires modifying additional files, stop and ask for permission first
